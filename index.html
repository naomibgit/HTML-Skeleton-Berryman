    <p>
      Hello! My name is Naomi Berryman, and I am a Computer Information Systems 
      student at Florida A&M University. I created this webpage as part of my 
      coursework to demonstrate my understanding of HTML fundamentals and 
      version control with GitHub. I'm excited to build my skills in web 
      development, programming, and information systems throughout this course.
